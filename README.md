## ðŸŽ® Overview

**Out of Africa** is an interactive, text-based game where players take on the role of early humans migrating from Africa. Inspired by the *Oregon Trail* game, this project uses narrative choices to teach kids about the paths our ancestors took and the natural challenges they facedâ€”like rivers, deserts, mountains, and shifting climates.

This project is both fun and informative, combining class materials (slides and guest lectures) with additional research on early human migration and environmental geography.
